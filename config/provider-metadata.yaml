        description: Manages multiple Grafana Mimir rule groups within a namespace. This resource is designed to handle YAML files containing multiple rule groups, such as those exported from mimirtool or monitoring mixins. Each rule group is managed individually via the Mimir API, but they are tracked together as a single Terraform resource for easier bulk management.
